--> Discuss the solution cost of your LE:

Answer:

1. We are sending messages asynchronously. 
2. In worst case message cost is O(n * n).
3. But in average case we reduced the message overhead with some state management.



--> Discuss whether your LE fulfills the properties of a correct LE algo:

Answer: 
We are using the concept of Bully Algorithm. But we are not completely following it's protocol.
So our implementation doesn't fulfills all the properties of correct LE algorithm.

For example, we are using server ip string as it's identifier which is not actually property of correct LE. 



--> Discuss the cost of adding messages to the board:

Answer:
For n servers we need to send n messages to add a new entry.


--> Discuss pros&cons of centralized solutions:

Answer:
Pros:
1. Data is Consistent.
2. Easy to implement.

Cons:
1. Not Scalable. Leader server handles all (add/modify/delete) requests.
2. System fails when centralized node is not available.
